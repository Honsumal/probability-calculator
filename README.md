# Simple Probability Calculator

## Description
This application is an easy-to-use probability calculator that simulates large iterations of independent events with the same probability. Common examples of usage include calculating the odds of getting a particular unit from a gatcha game, or calculating the expected number of tries to pass a given threshold, such as when melding materia in FFXIV. 

Currently, the application only supports basic calculations wherein the probability does not change throughout the simulation. Planned extensions to the application include the following:

- Adding a 'currency used' variable to the calculation, allowing for users to learn the impact of their simulation on their resources (financial or virtual).
- Adding functionality to change the probabilty as the number of disfavoured outcomes increase.

Please feel free to add suggested features in the issues page.
